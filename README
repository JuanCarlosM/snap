[About]
 Snap is a python utility to take and restore system snapshots. 
 Included is the python snap library; two executables, snaptool 
 for the command line and gsnap for GTK; and the documentation.

[Installing]
 'make install' - its that easy

[Running]
 'man snap' or 'snaptool --help' for all available options
 snaptool --backup --verbose
 snaptool --restore --snapfile /tmp/snap-12.06.2007-23.57.54.tgz --verbose
 gsnap

[Package Systems]
 To write a plugin to snap for your package system (call it Pkgms) add a file
 called PkgmsPluginSystem.py to PACKAGE_SYSTEMS_DIR as defined in 
 snap/snapoptions.py. In this file, derive a class called PkgmsPluginSystem from
 snap.packagesystem.PackageSystemBase and override ALL the methods. 
 Set the "packagesystem" option in the snap config file snap.conf to "pkgms",
 and lastly add your package module to the setup.py installer script
