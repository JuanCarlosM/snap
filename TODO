TODO:
 - Additional backends:
   - different package systems (ubuntu, rhel, gentoo, windows, apple)
   - different services
   - bootloader configuration
   - filesystem options, acls, and extended attributes
   - partition layout, swap, lvm config (perhaps w/ a small boostrapping iso/setup)
 - Incremental snapshots
 - Snapshot registry
 - Encrypted snapshots (perhaps just leave this up to admin to use gpg?)
 - Scheduled snapshots (perhaps just leave this up to cron?)
 - Internationalize text
 - Taking remote snapshots (Snap! server)
 - Snap partition from which snapshots can be saved to / restored from
 - Register generic hooks to be performed at different stages
